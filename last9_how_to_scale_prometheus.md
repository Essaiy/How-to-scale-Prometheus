**How to Scale Prometheus**
Here is a step-by-step guide to scaling Prometheus in distributed software environments. 

1. Horizontal Scaling
Instead of relying on a single server, horizontal scaling allows you to add more servers or instances to handle the load collectively. Here are some common horizontal scaling techniques.

a. Load Balancing
A load balancer acts as a central entry point, distributing workload evenly and efficiently across available resources to avoid server overload. You can implement load balancing by using Nginx.

      ```yaml
      version: '3'
      
      services:
        prometheus1:
          build: .
        prometheus2:
          build: .
        prometheus3:
          build: .
        
        load_balancer:
          image: nginx
          ports:
            - 8080:80
          volumes:
            - ./nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf
      ```

Configure `nginx.conf` to specify load balancing rules.

b. Federation
Federation allows a Prometheus server to scrape metrics from another server, but the reason for doing this may differ, hence the two types of federation: hierarchical or cross-service. Cross-service federation allows developers to monitor the behavior of instances/servers monitoring application behavior. However, hierarchical federation involves configuring multiple instances of Prometheus such that high-level servers collect metrics from several low-level servers for collective querying. Hierarchical federation is the most relevant here, as it is used for scaling Prometheus. 

To implement federation, use the `scrape_configs` section in the `prometheus.yml` file to define your federation configuration.

      ```yaml
      global:
        scrape_interval: 15s
      
      scrape_configs:
        - job_name: 'prometheus1' # Configuration for Prometheus instance 1
          static_configs:
            - targets: ['prometheus1:9090']
      
        - job_name: 'prometheus2' # Configuration for Prometheus instance 2
          static_configs:
            - targets: ['prometheus2:9090']
      
        - job_name: 'prometheus3' # Configuration for Prometheus instance 3
          static_configs:
            - targets: ['prometheus3:9090']
      ```

OR

   ```
   prometheus:
     - job_name: 'federate'
       scrape_interval: 15s
       honor_labels: true
       metrics_path: '/federate'
       params:
         'match[]':
           - '{job!=""}'
       static_configs:
         - targets:
           - 'prometheus1:9090'
           - 'prometheus2:9090'
           - 'prometheus3:9090'
   ```

c. Sharding
Sharding involves dividing workloads into smaller subsets and distributing them across multiple servers or instances. Unlike federation where lower-level servers branch off from higher-level servers, shards are independent servers. To implement sharding, use the `prometheus.yml` file to specify separate configurations for each shard.

      ```yaml
      global:
        scrape_interval: 15s
      
      scrape_configs:
        - job_name: 'shard1' # Configuration for shard 1
          static_configs:
            - targets: ['shard1:9090']
      
        - job_name: 'shard2' # Configuration for shard 2
          static_configs:
            - targets: ['shard2:9090']
      ```

OR

  ```
   - job_name: 'sharding'
     metrics_path: /metrics
     params:
       query: '{instance="instance1"}'
     relabel_configs:
       - source_labels: [__param_query]
         regex: "({[^}]+})"
         target_label: __hash__
         modul o: 2
         action: hashmod
     static_configs:
       - targets:
         - target1
         - target2
   ```

In summary, horizontal scaling is the distribution of workload. For example, Cloudflare scales Prometheus by configuring: 
scrape, label length and sample limits to reduce server workload and ensure only necessary metrics are exported for sampling.

server checks running in CI (continuous integration) to ensure modifications to scrape, label length and sample limit configurations do not result in server overload; and 

a set of Prometheus custom patches for limiting metrics stored in Prometheus’ TSDB and for ignoring excess time series where they could have led to server failure. 

2. Service Discovery
Another way to scale Prometheus is to utilize mechanisms like Kubernetes or Consul for dynamic target discovery. This ensures automatic scaling as new instances are added to the infrastructure. Here's an example using Prometheus with Kubernetes.

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
   kind: Prometheus
   metadata:
     name: prometheus
   spec:
     serviceMonitorSelector:
       matchLabels:
         app.kubernetes.io/name: your_app_label
   ```
Configure the `serviceMonitorSelector` to match the labels of the target services you want to monitor.

OR

   ```
   - job_name: kubernetes-pods
     kubernetes_sd_configs:
       - role: pod
     relabel_configs:
       - source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_pod_label_app]
         separator: ;
         regex: my_app
         replacement: $1
         action: keep
   ```

In addition, Prometheus can be scaled with Kubernetes by configuring the horizontal pod autoscaling (HPA) feature in Kubernetes. It scales the number of Prometheus instances—run as pods—based on CPU or custom metrics. 

3. Partitioning
Dividing metric collection across multiple Prometheus clusters can improve workload distribution and query performance. By separating metrics based on certain criteria (e.g., by geographic region, service type or any other relevant dimension), it becomes easier to scale Prometheus and handle larger deployments efficiently. Here's an example using Docker Swarm.

   ```yaml
   version:
version: '3.7'

   services:
     prometheus_cluster1:
       build: .
     prometheus_cluster2:
       build: .
     prometheus_cluster3:
       build: .
   
   networks:
     prometheus_cluster1:
       external: true
     prometheus_cluster2:
       external: true
     prometheus_cluster3:
       external: true

   ```
Configure the Docker Swarm with multiple Prometheus clusters, each residing in a separate network to enable workload division across clusters.

4. Storage Optimization
Optimize Prometheus storage by following these techniques.

a. Compression
Enable metric compression by setting the `storage.tsdb.compress` option to true in the `prometheus.yml` file.

      ```yaml
      storage:
        tsdb:
          compress: true
      ```

b. Retention Policies
Configure appropriate retention policies to manage data volumes stored by Prometheus. Set the `storage.tsdb.retention` option in the `prometheus.yml` file to define the time duration for which you intend to retain the data.

      ```yaml
      storage:
        tsdb:
          retention: 30d
      ```

c. Remote Storage
Offload metrics to a remote, long-term storage system, such as Amazon S3 or Google Cloud Storage. Configure the remotewrite and read endpoints in the `prometheus.yml` file.

      ```yaml
      remote_write:
        - url: "http://remote-storage-endpoint/write"
        
      remote_read:
        - url: "http://remote-storage-endpoint/read"
      ```

Replace "remote-storage-endpoint" with the actual endpoint URL.

d. Increase Scrape Interval
Increase the scrape interval for metrics that do not require frequent updates to prevent scraping unnecessary metrics that consume memory resources. Adjust the `--storage.tsdb.max-block-duration` configuration.

5. Monitoring and Alerting
Monitor Prometheus and configure alerts to email or Slack when certain conditions are met. Here's an example of an alerting rule in the `prometheus.yml` file.

   ```yaml
   alerting:
     alertmanagers:
       - static_configs:
           - targets: ['alertmanager:9093']
   
   rules:
     - alert: HighRequestLatency
       expr: http_request_latency_seconds > 0.5
       for: 5m
       labels:
         severity: warning
       annotations:
         summary: High latency detected
         description: A high request latency of {{ $value }} seconds was detected.
   ```
Incorporate the Alertmanager into Prometheus to scale alerts. You can also shard alerts—based on their nature— across multiple Prometheus instances, or configure multiple instances of Alertmanager behind a load balancer to distribute incoming alert notifications. 

6. Utilizing Additional Tools
Tools like Thanos and Levitate, which provide solutions for distributed storage and query federation, can be integrated into Prometheus for improved vertical scalability. Here's a brief overview of how these tools scale Prometheus.

a. Thanos
Thanos is an open-source project that allows for long-term storage  through Amazon S3 and Google Cloud Storage, and global querying of metrics from multiple Prometheus instances. Thanos is highly available because it replicates data across multiple storage systems. Below is an example of configuring Thanos as a remote storage solution.

   ```yaml
   remote_write:
     - url: "http://thanos-sidecar:19291/api/v1/receive"
   remote_read:
     - url: "http://thanos-querier:9090/api/v1/query"
   ```

The `remote_write` and `remote_read` sections in `prometheus.yml` specify the URLs for writing and reading data from Thanos.

b. Levitate 
[Levitate]([url](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230117005901/en/Introducing-Levitate-%E2%80%98Uplifting%E2%80%99-Your-Metrics-Woes-Because-Self-Management-Sucks-Like-Gravity)) is a vendor-agnostic, highly available time series data warehouse that incorporates query-routing, consumption engines and data-tiering to reduce the total cost of ownership of a data warehouse, ensure faster queries and proactive alerting. Levitate’s consumption engines control data growth, and alert on and prevent cardinality explosion. Its query-routing feature reduces operational overhead of expensive queries while its data-tiering component automatically tiers time series being sent to storage based on their specific use case to allow different teams have concurrent access. 

[Levitate]([url](https://last9.io/blog/levitate-vs-google-managed-prometheus/)) offers both SaaS and managed deployment, but its managed service takes lesser time to run without hidden egress data transfer costs. View a [demo here]([url](https://last9.io/schedule-demo/)). 

**What are the best practices when scaling Prometheus?**

Follow these best practices to effectively scale Prometheus. 

1. Thorough Testing
Before implementing scalability changes in production, thoroughly test them in a staging or test environment to identify and resolve (potential) issues.

2. Monitoring and Alerting
Continuously monitor and alert on Prometheus’ performance for proactive identification  and resolution of performance issues.

3. Continuous Optimization
Regularly review and optimize your scaling strategies by analyzing query performance and resource utilization to ensure efficiency in dynamic environments.

4. Efficient Storage and Retention
Define appropriate metrics retention policies. Consider using long-term storage solutions like object storage for historical data. This optimizes resource utilization while retaining crucial data for analysis.

5. Relabeling and Metric Filtering
Relabeling involves dynamic modification of metric labels so you can drop irrelevant metrics and labels. Metric filtering enables the exclusion or selection of specific metrics for processing. Both techniques help to improve query performance and eradicate redundant metrics. 

Relabeling Example:

```yaml
- job_name: 'myjob'
  static_configs:
    - targets: ['target1:9090', 'target2:9090']
  metric_relabel_configs:
    - source_labels: [__name__]
      regex: '^(metric.*)'
      target_label: metric_name
```

Metric Aggregation Example:

```yaml
- job_name: 'myjob'
  static_configs:
    - targets: ['target1:9090', 'target2:9090']
  metric_relabel_configs:
    - source_labels: [__name__]
      regex: '^(metric.*)'
      target_label: metric_name
  metric_aggregation_configs:
    - regex: 'metric_(\w+)'
      label_name: label_name
      label_value: $1
      action: labelmap
```

In the relabeling example, the `metric_relabel_configs` section is used to relabel metrics. The regex `^(metric.*)` captures metrics starting with "metric_" and categorizes them using the `metric_name` target label to improve metric organization.

The metric aggregation example demonstrates both relabeling and metric aggregation. The regex `metric_(\w+)` captures metrics with a "metric_" prefix and extracts the label value using the `$1` expression. The extracted value is assigned to a new label called `label_name`, using the `labelmap` action to provide a comprehensive view of the data.

6. Reducing the Complexity of PromQL Queries
Techniques like using subqueries, reducing the number of functions, and using labeling conventions help simplify and speed up queries. Find below a PromQL query optimization example.

```bash
# Original query
sum(rate(http_requests_total{job="myjob"}[5m])) by (status)

# Optimized query
sum by (status) (rate(http_requests_total{job="myjob"}[5m]))
```
In this example, the query is optimized by moving the `by (status)` clause to the beginning to eliminate the need for an intermediate aggregation step and improve performance.
